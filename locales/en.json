With timely, comprehensive, and reliable project data, RootData has won the favor of hundreds of thousands of crypto users.",
      "text2": "In this process, an increasing number of users have participated in the data construction process, periodically identifying gaps and errors in our database, and making exceptional contributions to the platform's development and user experience. In order to incentivize these active users involved in the co-construction of our database, we introduce a points reward program. We believe that each user's efforts should be rewarded accordingly and share in the benefits of the platform's growth.",

The types of contributions include submitting content feedback, suggesting unrecorded projects, creating high-quality compilations, etc. Users can earn corresponding points after their information submission is approved. Please refer to the table below for details.",
      "text5": "Specifically, users who have bookmarked or provided feedback between December 2022 and June 31 2023 could receive 20 points as a bonus. Meanwhile, bookmarking 5 or more projects/organizations, submitting feedback to 5 or more different projects, and creating public compilations that were selected for the channel homepage will have users' points doubled. Note that bonus multipliers can be stacked.",
      "text6": "In the future, points can be used to redeem various gifts, such as partner platform memberships, NFT whitelist spots, etc. Also, users who accumulate a certain amount of points will be able to redeem NFTs with different rights. Currently, the point redemption function has not been opened, and more benefits are being planned.",
